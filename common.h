   - 16-bit integer.
   - 32-bit integer.
   - a 8-bit character (ASCII code).

 * info_ is defined  "unsigned char" because reading a number byte by byte dose not allow any mistakes in type conversion involving the HSB.

   sequence number or other signaling appearing in a short test, so we do not need functions for 64-bit number.
